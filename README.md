## 🗂 Dataset Description

The database follows a classic retail schema:

- **customers** – customer details (name, city)
- **products** – product information (category, price)
- **orders** – customer orders with order dates
- **order_items** – line-level sales data (product, quantity)

Revenue is calculated as:

revenue = quantity × price
